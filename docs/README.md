# Docsify Pseudocode

## What it is

**docsify-pseudocode** is a plugin based on [pseudocode.js](https://github.com/SaswatPadhi/pseudocode.js) to render pseudocode in docsify. Using it, you can easily write pseudocode like Latex's algorithm packages in the markdown document.

## Features

All features come from pseudocode.js.

- **Intuitive grammar:** docsify-pseudocode takes a LaTeX-style input that supports the algorithmic constructs from LaTeX's algorithm packages. With or without LaTeX experience, a user should find the grammar fairly intuitive.
- **Print quality:** The HTML output produced by docsify-pseudocode is (almost) identical with the pretty algorithms printed on publications that are typeset by LaTeX.
- **Math formula support:** Inserting math formulas in docsify-pseudocode is as easy as LaTeX. Just enclose math expression in `$...$` or `\(...\)`.
- **Multiple backends:** docsify-pseudocode supports [KaTex](https://github.com/KaTeX/KaTeX) and [MathJax](https://github.com/mathjax/MathJax) to render math formulas.
